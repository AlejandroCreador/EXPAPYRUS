# PDF-image-to-text
The Python program processes scanned PDFs by converting each page into an image, applying Tesseract OCR to extract text, identifying unreadable sections, translating the extracted text into Spanish using the Google Translate API, and generating a new PDF that includes the translated text with highlighted unreadable areas.
